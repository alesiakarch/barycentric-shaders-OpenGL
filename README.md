WIP idea
 
I am interested in painted shaders and creating NPR look.
Maybe I could try to develop one (The Wild Robot, Acrane as a reference image)
I don't know a lot about shaders yet though, so I am unsure wether this idea is in this project's scope or not.
Most likely it will require scaling up or down. Doing more initial research at the moment.
